<p>This project was done to help learn Laravel and set up a simple task management application.  Tutorial followed was from <a href=“https://www.flynsarmy.com/2015/02/creating-a-basic-todo-application-in-laravel-5-part-1/“ >Flynsarmy.com</a>.  Most of the tutorial was followed with the exception of the 4th step - I do not like validating in the Controller I preferred to use Requests for my validation.</p>
